# This is a very simple and easy document for PaintsTransfer

First of all, our APP is here:

This is a very simple and easy document for PaintsTransfer. You can finish this document in one minute.

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/img2/2.png)

Firstly, you can upload the line drawing with this button.

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/img2/3.png)

Then, you select an artist on the left. Or you can upload a reference image.

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/img2/4.png)

Then you can add some hints by drawing some color on the canvas. If you are lazy, you can skip this step.

You will get some **low-quality** preview when you are adding hints.

**Left mouse button: add hints.**

**Mouse wheel : resize the canvas.**

**Right mouse button: move the canvas.**

Finally you should click the "brain" button here to output the final result.

**Keep in mind that the preview is (!!!!!!!) NOT (!!!!!!!) the final result!**

**We add the low-quality preview to improve the user-experience, and to give you some feedbacks when you are adding hints. But the preview is of very low quality and this is definately NOT the best performance of PaintsTransfer. You really should click the "brain" button to see the high-quality result.**

The one minute document is end. You can enjoy now.

Line drawing (after our fully automatic rendering): 2048 \* 4096

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/img2/10.png)

Low-quality solid color: 2048 \* 4096

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/img2/11.png)

Solid color: 2048 \* 4096

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/img2/12.png)

Final high-quality solid color with no lines: 2048 \* 4096

You can import this to photoshop to speed up your digital painting.

# How can I save my hints?

It is easy. You can click the small triangle here and use the two buttons.

![p1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/style2paints/style2paints.github.io/master/img2/7.png)

You will get a text file if you click download button, and you will be asked to input some text code if you click the upload button. You can save and load your hints in this way.

# Why my results are blank?

Do not use firefox.
